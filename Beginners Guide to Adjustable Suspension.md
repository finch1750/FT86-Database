From factory this FRS/BRZ lack camber adjustment in both the front and rear of the car. This thread is to outline the options for gaining camber adjustment (and more in time) with some of the differences in the varying options. I am in no way an expert. I have simply spent a lot of time trying not to screw up my own car and see questions related to this info asked often and people getting tired of repeating themselves. Also please note if you race in SCCA/NASA/86Cup/etc some items are limited based on class. I did my best to list legal parts for SCCA Solo 2 but am the not governing body so double check. Please do your research before purchasing on what is legal and what isn’t. All adjustment ranges are approximate and vary from car to car.

I am in no way responsible for any damage you do to your own car based on your choices regarding the topics in this thread. I also do not endorse any companies listed or vouch that they make quality products. Do your own research and always have a licensed mechanic perform installs and adjustments.

##Front camber:


###Camber bolts:### Camber bolts are a cheap, easy way to gain adjustable camber in the front of the car. They do not have the range of camber plates but are enough for many (up to +/-2.5 degrees possibly). There are a few options for camber bolts.

OEM aka crash bolts (Toyota SU003-02818; Subaru 901000394): This is a 14mm bolt that replaces the 16mm bolt in the upper hole on your strut. It is able to take the torque needed to tighten with enough force to not slip since it is smaller than the hole it is inserted in. Adjustment is done by moving the strut in or out changing the camber and then tightening. While I can’t find specific numbers this bolt tends to add approximately between +/- .5 to 1 degree camber. This bolt is the same as the factory bolt in the lower hole on your stock struts. CS legal camber adjustment

SPC 81280 or Whiteline KCA416 : It is a 16mm eccentric bolt installed in the upper strut hole. This bolt has a lobe that adjusts the strut angle by rotating the bolt when installed. Adds approximately +/- 1.5 degree camber. Whiteline bolt is a repackaged SPC bolt listed first.

SPC 81305 or 81260: This is a 14mm eccentric camber bolt that is installed in the lower hole. This bolt has a lobe that adjusts the strut angle by rotating the bolt when installed. Adds approximately +/- 1.75 degrees camber.



Pro-tip: If you install 14mm eccentric bolts in the lower strut hole, you now have a "spare" OEM crash bolt. Swap the OEM bottom bolt into the top strut hole for greater adjustability. This is how to achieve upwards of -2.5 on stock struts with just camber bolts.

Adjustable top mounts aka camber plates: Camber plates provide a much wider range of adjustment over camber bolts. They also replace the oem rubber top mounts and often are made of only metal (few exceptions like the Whiteline Com-C). While this has handling benefits as you eliminate slop it can add to NVH. Camber plates cost a few hundred dollars compared to under $40 for camber bolts. Depending on how they are designed some camber plates may raise/lower ride height slightly. Some camber plates also include caster adjustment as well.

Some companies that make camber plates for the twins:
Beatrush
Ground Control
HVT (no longer in business)
Racecomp Engineering
Raceseng
Velox/FT86Speed Factory
Whiteline

Front lower control arms:


Racer X adjustable front lower control arms. These have both camber and caster adjustment. The standard range of adjustment is approximately +1 to -4 degrees camber. Caster adjustment is the full range until contact is made front or rear in the wheel well. An extended version is available for up to -6 degrees camber and custom set-ups are available up to -18 degrees of camber 

Parts Shop Max have front control arms as well. It appears to only be sold as a full front kit with tie rods, adjustable knuckles, etc. Meant for extreme steering angle.

Powerflex PFF69-801G: FLCA rear bushing that claims to adjust camber +/- 1 degree




Rear Camber


Rear Camber Bolts: While not confirmed on H&R's website as fitting the Zx6 chassis users have reported using H&R TC112 camber bolts in the rear struts upper hole to gain =/- .5 degrees camber. Minimal cost for minimum gain that could possibly even out if mismatched too greatly side to side. These are eccentric so as always be sure to check for slippage

Rear lower control arms (LCA): Adjustable LCAs are a relatively cheap and simple for gaining adjustable camber in the rear. There are many options with various adjustments and bushing types. Some also will have multiple mounting locations for swaybars to help tweak other handling characteristics as well. The downside to LCAs is camber changes done here will affect toe as well.

Some companies that offer adjustable LCA:
Agency Power
Blox
Buddy Club
Cusco
DME
GT Spec
ISC
Megan
Parts Shop Max
Racer X (STX legal config available)
RSR (STX legal)
SPC (STX legal With DiF bushing installed)
SPL
Stance
Voodoo13
Velox (STX legal config available)
Whiteline (STX legal)

Rear Upper control arm (UCA): Expensive and limited choices, but allows for wider range of camber adjustment compared to other options and changes are independent of toe.

Some companies that offer adjustable UCA:
MSI
Racer X

Rear UCA bushings: These are the cheapest option in terms of purchasing cost. However, they offer limited adjustment ( approximately +/- .75 degrees) and also usually require a shop to install them as an air hammer and press are required to remove the old bushings. These are also an extreme PITA to adjust so your alignment guy might start to hate you. They do however really tighten up the rear end with a harder compound bushing. Non-adjustable versions are also available.

Companies that offer adjustable upper control arm bushings:
Whiteline (STX legal)
Powerflex




Toe

Toe can be adjusted from factory and has a large enough adjustment range for most vehicles that are not running crazy camber and/or are slammed. There are however options for adjustable toe links in the rear and a few options for aftermarket outer tie rods in the front. Outer tie rods also can help with bump steer correction on lowered vehicles.

Some companies that offer adjustable outer tie rods:
Parts Shop Max
Racer X
SPL

Cusco

Useful threads regarding alignment and suspension:

Alignment FAQ
@Dezoris outlines factory specs and many questions to think about before buying, before the alignment, and for when the alignment is actually done. Great read and what kinda inspired me to put this together. I just felt it was missing some of the things like what adjusts what and options beyond his personal experiences and set-up.
